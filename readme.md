# Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
This pattern allows us to work with the same object contained in the memory to avoid unnecessary object creations.

### Factory Method 
This is a creational design pattern that serves to create related objects via an interface. 

### Abstract Factory
This is also a  creational pattern that uses several interfaces to create related objects. Abstract factory allows us to switch easily between objects without changing the main code.

### Builder
That enables us to create different products using the same construction process with the help of abstract classes.
